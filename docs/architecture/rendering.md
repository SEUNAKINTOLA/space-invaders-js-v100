### Key Components

1. **Canvas Manager**
   - Handles canvas initialization and context management
   - Implements resolution scaling and pixel ratio adjustments
   - Manages canvas clearing and buffer swapping

2. **Render Queue**
   - Priority-based rendering system
   - Batches similar draw calls for performance
   - Implements z-index sorting for proper layering

3. **Sprite Management**
   - Texture atlas support for efficient sprite rendering
   - Sprite pooling for memory optimization
   - Frame-based animation system

## Performance Optimizations

### Rendering Techniques

- Double buffering for smooth animation
- Request Animation Frame synchronization
- GPU acceleration where available
- Dirty rectangle tracking for partial updates

### Memory Management
