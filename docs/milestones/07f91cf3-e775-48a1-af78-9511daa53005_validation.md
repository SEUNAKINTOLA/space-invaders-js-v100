   - Add frame interpolation for sub-pixel movement
   - Consider WebGL acceleration for rendering

2. **Quality Improvements**
   - Add visual feedback for movement state
   - Implement screen shake effects
   - Add movement sound effects
   - Consider adaptive movement speed

3. **Future Enhancements**
   - Controller support
   - Touch controls for mobile
   - Customizable key bindings
   - Advanced movement patterns

## 8. Validation Conclusion

The player controls and movement system has passed all critical validation criteria and meets the project's performance requirements. The implementation demonstrates robust handling of input, consistent frame timing, and efficient memory management.

### Final Status: ✅ APPROVED
